# F1-Rev-Lights-Python
Rev-Lights for all F1 with UDP, created with python, for raspberry GPIO.

This program has to be used in an raspberry or other thing that runs python, the code have to be verified if you are having any trouble,
the program have a config file who's are in .json type, but, it can be insufficient, this program run with F1 UDP 2018, but i believe it 
can run in other F1 UDP versions, just changing the structs file (i will test & update it, i guess), if you want to do this manually you can
search for the F1 {version} UDP doc (i guess).
